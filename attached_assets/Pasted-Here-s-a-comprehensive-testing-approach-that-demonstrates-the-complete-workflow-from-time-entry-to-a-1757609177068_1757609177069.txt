Here's a comprehensive testing approach that demonstrates the complete workflow from time entry to approval with admin verification at each step:

End-to-End Approval Workflow Test Plan
Phase 1: Setup & Worker Time Entry
Login as Worker (e.g., john@example.com)
Enter time for current week on an active job:
Navigate to timesheet page
Select a job (e.g., "SPRING-002")
Enter hours for today: 8 hours, Acoustical work
Submit the timesheet
Verify time entry created (should show as saved)
Phase 2: Admin Check - Before Approval
Login as Admin (admin@example.com)
Run Employee Hours Report:
Date range: Current week (Monday to Sunday)
Format: CSV Preview
Expected Result: Should show John's 8 hours with "Pending" approval status
Run Payroll Report:
Same date range
Format: CSV Preview
Expected Result: Should show NO entries (payroll only shows approved time)
Phase 3: Foreman Approval
Login as Foreman (if job has assigned foreman, or admin can approve)
Navigate to approval workflow:
Go to foreman dashboard
Find John's time for SPRING-002 job
Click "Approve" for current week
Review and approve timesheet:
Verify 8 hours shows correctly
Submit approval
Expected: Success message, week becomes locked
Phase 4: Admin Check - After Approval
Login as Admin again
Run Employee Hours Report:
Same date range as before
Expected Result: John's 8 hours now shows "Yes" approval status
Run Payroll Report:
Same date range
Expected Result: Now shows John's 8 hours (approved entries appear)
Run Job Labor Report:
Expected Result: Shows 8 hours under SPRING-002 job with proper totals
Phase 5: Verification & Validation
Verify totals are consistent across reports:
Employee Hours: 8 hours for John
Payroll: 8 hours for John (approved only)
Job Labor: 8 hours allocated to SPRING-002
Test approval lock:
Try to edit John's time entry for that week
Expected: Should be prevented (week is locked)
Expected Status Transitions
Stage	Employee Hours Report	Payroll Report	Status
After Time Entry	8 hours - "Pending"	0 hours (empty)	❌ Not approved
After Approval	8 hours - "Yes"	8 hours	✅ Approved
Key Validation Points
Approval Status Changes: "Pending" → "Yes"
Payroll Integration: Approved entries appear in payroll reports
Total Consistency: Same hours across all report types
Weekly Lock: Prevents further edits after approval
Role Permissions: Each user can only access appropriate functions
This test demonstrates the complete construction timesheet business workflow and validates that your approval system works correctly with proper reporting status throughout the process!
